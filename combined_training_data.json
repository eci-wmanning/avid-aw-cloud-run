If the home is left unheated in the winter, floors and walls may provide cold surfaces on which moisture in the warmer crawl space air may condense. iv. Moisture inside a heated home may reach the dew point within floor insulation or on the colder bottom surface of the vapor barrier. Moisture on or under the poly vapor barrier may result from condensation or hydrostatic pressure. This is a normal condition. v.

Some attics are sealed or finished as conditioned space and do not require outside ventilation. It is the consumer's responsibility to keep the vent locations free from obstructions. In high wind-driven rain events (e.g., over 40 mph), rain that is in the wind will flow with the wind into attics. Louvers in gable end vents can keep large drops of water out of attics when wind speeds are low. However, at even moderate wind speeds the wind will carry water drops with it. It is unavoidable because there is no practical mechanism to separate drops (especially very small ones) from air. Small drops can be like trying to separate drops of fog from air. In short-duration rain events, the accumulation of water may be so small as not to be noticed; however, during tropical depressions and hurricanes, the water can accumulate to damaging quantities. The best preventative measure is to completely block gable end vents during such events. Gable end vents with hinged louvers still can allow wind driven rain to enter an attic in damaging quantities. When rain enters an attic, it can accumulate to such an extent on the top of ceiling drywall that the drywall weakens and the ceiling collapses  Roof Coverings6-  Note: There are many kinds of roofing products.
